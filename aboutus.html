<h2>The place</h2></br></br>
<p>Boarded by the golden shores that fringe the Indian Ocean, Laguna Beach Villa is a peaceful hideaway 
for those seeking complete privacy and tranquility in a luxurious setting. The newly renovated four roomed
 villa with its homely comforts boasts of modern architecture with a blend of tradition in keeping with its
 country setting. The interior of the hotel and all its rooms are tastefully designed to give the feeling of being 
 as one with nature. The beautifully landscaped lawn which stretches to the ocean is adorned with colorful flower 
 beds and the easy chairs on the verandah is the perfect place to munch on some sandwiches while sipping a cup of
 pure Ceylon tea. The villa’s own swimming pool that comes with sundecks and sunshades is ideal for some secluded 
 fun under the sun. The villa is ideally suited for family vacations, 
groups and even individuals who believe in spending quality time amidst nature’s bounty.</p>

Airport making it a convenient location to and from the airport. It is also just 35 minutes 
away from the capital city of Colombo (35km) giving patrons the opportunity to travel to the 
city for entertainment, sightseeing or business activities. The location of the villa also makes it 
the ideal home base from where visitors can indulge in sightseeing tours especially to Negombo, a key

and its abundance of water sports and recreation activities; all this just 25 minutes away from the villa.</p>
